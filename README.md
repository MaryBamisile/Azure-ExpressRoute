#### Firstly, we create Vnet and Gateway subnet.

1. Go to your Azure portal and search for Virtual Networks.

2. Fill in the parameters and also add a subnet selecting VNet Gateway as the purpose.

3. You can leave others on default value.

###### Azure VPN Gateway connects your on-premises networks to Azure through Site-to-Site VPNs in a similar way that you set up and connect to a remote branch office. The connectivity is secure and uses the industry-standard protocols Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE).

The creation takes some time. Hence, remain calm while at it!

Next step is create the "ExpressRoute" resource

In Azure portal marketplace, search for ExpressRoute and create.

After the resource is done creating, on the overview page for service key as it will be required to reach out to your connectivity provider for provisioning.

The status of provisioning can always be checked for thesame overview page.
